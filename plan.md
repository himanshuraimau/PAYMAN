### **Backend Flow for AI-Powered Affiliate Management System**  

#### **1. Data Ingestion**  
- Admin enters conversion data manually or via an API.  
- The system fetches data from a link tracking service (e.g., Bitly, UTM tracking, custom tracking system).  
- Data is stored in a PostgreSQL or MongoDB database.  

#### **2. AI Processing and Analysis**  
- AI agent processes affiliate conversion data.  
- AI evaluates affiliate performance based on key metrics (conversions, revenue, customer quality).

- AI calculates commission payouts based on predefined rules.  

#### **3. Payment Processing**  
- AI determines if payments should be processed automatically or require manual approval.  
- Payment requests are created and sent to the payment processor (Stripe, ACH, USDC).
